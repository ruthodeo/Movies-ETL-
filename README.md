# Movies-ETL-
## Project Overview:
ETL is important for moving information ( Extract, Transform and Load) , in our project we are goint to create a connection or pipeline to move the information between data    bases, in this case, between python, panda and SQL database to take the informaton from wikipedia , kaggle metadata and movie lents ratings data and loaded into PostgreSQL database.

### Content :

    The ETL_function_test.ipynb file
    The ETL_clean_wiki_movies.ipynb file
    The ETL_clean_kaggle_data.ipynb file
    The ETL_create_database.ipynb file
    The Resources folder with the movies_query.png, and ratings_query.png files.
  
### Project STEPS
    
    1. Extract the files we need for our project.
    2. Import our programs and libraries in jupyter notebook (python)
